# Step One

![Step One](https://github.com/lavabit/tutorials/blob/master/geary/step1.png "Step One")

To add a new account to an existing Geary installation, click the file icon in the top left, click `Accounts`,
then click the plus sign button. Geary prompts you to add a new mail account upon the first successful launch of the application.

First, select `Other` at the top dropdown menu. Then in the name field, enter the name you would like to have
displayed to your recipients. You will most likely use your full name, but you are free to enter anything you wish, 
such as your company name or a short description of the account if it serves a particular purpose.

Fill out the IMAP and SMTP information, selecting either STARTTLS or SSL for security (they both provide the
same level) and let Geary choose the port number. You can check the box next to `Use IMAP credentials` to avoid
having to enter your Lavabit email address and password in twice.

Click `Add` when you are done filling out the form.

# Step Two

After Geary syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in your Inbox.
You can also try sending an email to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is a happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
