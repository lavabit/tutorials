Click `Next` through the `Welcome` and `Restore From Backup` steps to the `Identity` step. In the `Full Name`
Field, enter the name you would like to have displayed to your recipients. You will most likely use your full
name, but you are free to enter anything you wish, such as your company name or a short description of the
account if it serves a particular purpose.

Enter your Lavabit email address in the `Email Address` field.

# Step Three

Click `Next` and on the `Receiving Email` step choose between POP3 and IMAP for incoming mail. Then choose either
STARTTLS or SSL (both offer the same security), and let Evolution select the default port for you.

# Step Four

Click `Next` to reach a step where you can choose receiving options. The defaults are fine. Then click `Next` again
to reach the `Sending Email` step. Make sure to check `Server requires authentication` and enter your Lavabit
password below. You can choose either `PLAIN` or `LOGIN` for your authentication type.

# Step Five

After Evolution syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in your Inbox.
You can also try sending an email to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is a happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at `support@lavabit.com`.
