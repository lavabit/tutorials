# Step One

If you’re starting K-9 for the first time, it will automatically display the new account setup prompt. If
this is not your first mail account, then go to the accounts menu and tap the ‘Add account’ option in the
overflow menu.

On the first step, enter your Lavabit email address and password, then tap `Next`.

# Step Two

Select either POP3 or IMAP. IMAP has the benefit of leaving your messages on the server intact so that you
can sync your mail with multiple computers or devices.

# Step Three

Enter the server information, choosing either STARTTLS or SSL/TLS for security (both offer the same level).
Let k-9 choose the default port. Enter your Lavabit email address and password in the `Username` and
`Password` fields. Tap `Next`.

# Step Four

Perform the same steps from Step Three, only now for outbound messages.

# Step Five

In the `Name` field, enter the name you would like to have displayed to your recipients. You will most likely use your full
name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your company name or a short description of the
account if it serves a special purpose.

Finally, tap `Done`. After Evolution syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in
your Inbox. You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is the happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
